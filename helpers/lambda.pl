% Application  -> consists of a function name F and an argument E,

%		F is a Variable or constant and E can be any lambda-expresiopmn
% Abstraction ->  consists an Abstraction X and an argument E,
%	i.e. abst(X,E)

% Reduction -> a construct for this modul, where a lambda-Expresion is in a position to be applied to an abstraction
